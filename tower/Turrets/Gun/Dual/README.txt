 HOW TO USE :
-------------

For Dual Gun, play the first shot animation first and then switch to the looping shot animation afterwards chaining (self-looping) it up until the gun stops firing. Then when firing again or a new target (enemy) start with the first shot animation again first, repeating the process.
